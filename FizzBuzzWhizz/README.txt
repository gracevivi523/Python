This is practice for thoughtwork FizzBuzzWhizz test.
Suppose you are a P.E teacher, there is still 5 minutes to class over, you plan to play a game. You have 100 students in the class, the rule of game is :
1. First of all, define three different and specific numbers, such as 3,5,7.
2. Make all students in a queue, and then enable students number off one by one.
3. When students number off, if the number is the multiple of the 1st specific number, like 3, you should speak out 'Fizz' instead of 3; if the number is multiple of 2nd specific number, like 5, you should speak out 'Buzz' instead of 5;if the number is multiple of 3rd number, like 7, you should speak 'Whizz'.
4. When numbering off, if the number is multiple of both two specific numbers, you also need to do special handling, you should say 'FizzBuzz' instead of the number, by this analogy. If the number is multiple of the three specific numbers, you should speak 'FizzBuzzWhizz'.
5. When numbering off,if the bumber contains the 1st specific number, let's say the 1st specific number is 3, then the student who number off 13 should say 'Fizz', if the number contains 1st specific number, then ignore rule 3 and rule 4. For example, if you number off 35, you just say 'Fizz', you dont have to say 'BuzzWhizz'.
